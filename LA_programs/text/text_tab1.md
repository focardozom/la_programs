# Scoping Review of Youth ATOD Prevention Intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean

## Objective

Consistently high rates of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use by youth in Latin America and the Caribbean have called for the identification of preventive interventions that address this public health problem. In response, the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD-OAS) sponsored a scoping review of the literature and interviews with key informants to identify behavioral interventions that address youth ATOD use in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).

## Methods

A scoping review of published articles that met comprehensive search criteria was conducted via multiple bibliographic databases. The review was supplemented by key informant interviews with ATOD prevention experts throughout LAC.

## Results

Despite many articles that met the initial search criteria, only 57 articles contained information on youth ATOD preventive interventions, with 39 unique interventions being identified. Results of interviews with 47 key informants identified an additional 38 youth ATOD preventive interventions across 29 LAC countries for a total of 77 unique interventions. Fifty-one of these interventions were developed domestically and 26 were adapted from interventions outside the LAC region.

## Conclusions
  
The growing development and diffusion of preventive interventions for youth ATOD use in LAC countries calls for a standardized approach to collect, disseminate, and use information on these interventions for informed prevention planning. This investigation is the first of its kind to comprehensively review these interventions and thus provides an important step forward towards a science-based approach to reducing youth ATOD use in the region.
